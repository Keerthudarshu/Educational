## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Static Multi-Page Website**: The project uses a traditional multi-page architecture with separate HTML files for each major section (home, about, courses, admissions, results, contact, blog). This approach provides clear navigation structure and SEO benefits for an educational institute website.

**CSS Architecture**: Implements a modular CSS approach with separate files for main styles (`style.css`) and responsive design (`responsive.css`). Uses a mobile-first responsive design strategy with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts.

**JavaScript Modular Design**: JavaScript functionality is split into focused modules:
- `main.js` - Core navigation, animations, and general site functionality
- `forms.js` - Form validation, submission handling, and local storage
- `gallery.js` - Photo gallery, lightbox functionality, and image handling

**Design System**: Uses Inter font family from Google Fonts, Font Awesome icons for consistent iconography, and a structured color scheme focused on educational institution branding.

### Content Management

**Static Content Structure**: All content is embedded directly in HTML files, making the site lightweight and fast-loading. Course information, faculty details, and institutional content are maintained through direct HTML editing.

**SEO Optimization**: Each page includes proper meta descriptions, keywords, and structured navigation for search engine optimization, crucial for educational institutes competing for student attention.

### User Experience Features

**Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced features (animations, form validation, gallery) added through JavaScript for better user experience.

**Accessibility Considerations**: Implements proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and semantic HTML structure for screen readers and accessibility compliance.

**Performance Optimization**: Uses lazy loading for images, smooth scrolling animations, and optimized asset loading to ensure fast page speeds on various devices and connection speeds.

## External Dependencies

### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography

The architecture emphasizes simplicity, performance, and maintainability while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements like content management systems or dynamic features.
